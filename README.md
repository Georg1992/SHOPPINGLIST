SHOPPINGLIST-Androin Application

Do you ever go shopping with a shopping list? Do you make the list on paper?
Do you cook? I assume that you have some favorite recipes, right? Anyone find it
problematic to braimstorm about what to get whenever you do the grocery?
Lets think that it will take around 10-15 minutes to gather all the stuff you need. Personally, I also
sometimes miss many things crucial, for my favorite food instance. After all, I even need to rush to
market again to get it. Damn annoying right?

"Shopping List" is the solution; an application for generating your shopping list.
The application will be used by people who would like to customise their daily shopping and
cooking.

As a user I would like, to minimise the time spent on preparing for shopping and simplify the
cooking process.
Also I would like to put small daily tasks to my device, so that I don’t do the same things everyday.
People have habit to buy and consume the same things on the weekly basis. The Shopping List is
going to save your shopping choices and will efficiently customise them with your favourite
recipes.

Activities/Screens
The Home screen consists of a list of different categories; such as Bathroom Stuff, Kitchen items,
favourite recipes and basic grocery.
When you tab on any of the category, it opens another screen where you can add items to your
shopping list, and it contains a back button to the main screen where you can choose another
subcategory to add items.
In ‘favourite recipe’ one can add a recipe or use existing recipe.
When one is done adding items or removing items, ‘Shopping List’ generates a grocery list for you
on another screen.
Have fun shopping!
